In my first parts of setting up the test script, I created a base docker container that is running Ubuntu. I created a copy of the test.sh script inside the home directory, so the file is at ~/test.sh.

On another terminal window I use docker ps to check what the name of the running container is:

$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND       CREATED          STATUS          PORTS     NAMES
5f98e54075c1   ubuntu    "/bin/bash"   20 minutes ago   Up 19 minutes             nervous_curran

I am now able to use docker exec -it nervous_curran bash -c "bash ~/test.sh", and it will use the container's resources and output the command results into my terminal window. I checked with docker stats nervous_curran and made sure it was using the container's resources:

CONTAINER ID   NAME             CPU %     MEM USAGE / LIMIT     MEM %     NET I/O        BLOCK I/O   PIDS
5f98e54075c1   nervous_curran   108.68%   68.99MiB / 6.148GiB   1.10%     40MB / 754kB   0B / 0B     3

Now, at this point I just need to transpose these commands into one simple Python script. *Using Python 2.7

I am running unix commands via python using the subprocess module. The order of unix commands I run are:
	docker start nervous_curran
	docker exec -it nervous_curran bash -c "bash ~/test.sh"
	docker stop nervous_curran
